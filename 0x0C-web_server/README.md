Tasks Overview
Transfer a file to your server: Write a Bash script to transfer files securely using scp.
Install Nginx web server: Set up Nginx on your server to listen on port 80 and return "Hello World!" when queried at the root.
Setup a domain name: Configure DNS records to point your domain to your server's IP address.
Redirection: Configure Nginx to redirect /redirect_me to another page with a "301 Moved Permanently" status.
Not found page 404: Customize the Nginx server to display a custom 404 page containing the string "Ceci n'est pas une page".
