Project 0x0B. SSH
Overview
This ongoing project, initiated on April 19, 2024, is a part of DevOps and SysAdmin tasks focusing on SSH, Network, and Security. It's a second chance project with a deadline set for April 25, 2024, 6:00 AM, including an auto QA review at the deadline.

Optional: 0.0%
Calculation: 0.0% + (0.0% * 0.0%) == 0.0%
Background Context
In this project, you are provided with an Ubuntu server hosted in a remote datacenter, accessed via SSH using an RSA key instead of a password. The server is pre-configured with the public key generated in a previous task.
