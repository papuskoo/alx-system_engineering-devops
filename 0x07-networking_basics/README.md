Learning Objectives:

Upon completion of this project, learners are expected to be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

    OSI Model:
        Definition
        Number of layers
        Organization and function of each layer

    LAN (Local Area Network):
        Typical usage
        Geographical size

    WAN (Wide Area Network):
        Typical usage
        Geographical size

    Internet:
        IP address
        Types of IP addresses
        Localhost
        Subnet
        Reasons for IPv6 creation

    TCP/UDP:
        Mainly used data transfer protocols for IP
        Difference between TCP and UDP
        Port definition
        Memorization of common port numbers (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
        Tool/protocol for checking device connectivity

Requirements:

    Editors allowed: vi, vim, emacs
    Bash scripts should be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
    All files must end with a newline
    Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
    All Bash script files must be executable
    Bash scripts must pass shellcheck without errors
    First line of Bash scripts: #!/usr/bin/env bash
    Second line of Bash scripts: Comment explaining script's purpose

Additional Information:

    The project covers TCP/UDP protocols, focusing on the Transport and Network layers.
    Tasks include understanding the OSI model, types of networks, MAC and IP addresses, TCP/UDP protocols, and network troubleshooting tools.
    Learners are reminded to avoid plagiarism and to come up with solutions themselves to meet the learning objectives.
