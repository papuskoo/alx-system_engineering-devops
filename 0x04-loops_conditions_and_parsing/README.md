Project 0x04 - Loops, Conditions, and Parsing
Overview
This project focuses on developing skills in shell scripting, particularly in using loops, conditions, and parsing techniques. The tasks involve creating Bash scripts to perform various operations, including displaying messages, looping through data, and parsing log files. Throughout the project, the emphasis is on understanding the concepts of loops, conditions, and file parsing in the context of shell scripting.

Background Context
In the realm of DevOps and Shell Scripting, understanding how to effectively use loops, conditions, and parsing techniques is crucial. These skills enable developers to automate tasks, manage server configurations, and process data efficiently. By mastering these concepts, developers can create robust and efficient scripts to streamline various aspects of software development and system administration.

Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

Create SSH keys for secure remote access.
Utilize various loop constructs in Bash scripting, including for, while, and until.
Implement conditional statements (if, else, elif, case) in Bash scripts for decision-making.
Use file test operators to check file attributes and statuses.
Parse log files and extract relevant information using tools like awk.
Develop portable Bash scripts that adhere to best practices and conventions.
Ensure script reliability and correctness through Shellcheck and proper error handling.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
All files should end with a new line.
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
All Bash script files must be executable.
Do not use awk.
Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without any errors.
The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash.
The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script does.
