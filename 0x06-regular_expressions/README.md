RegexDevOps
This project focuses on mastering regular expressions (regex) using the Oniguruma library, primarily through Ruby scripting. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing.

Description
RegexDevOps is a project designed to enhance your understanding and proficiency in regular expressions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project offers a series of tasks to sharpen your regex skills. From simple pattern matching to more complex scenarios, each task provides a hands-on opportunity to delve deeper into regex concepts.

Concepts Covered
Regular Expressions
Pattern Matching
Text Processing
Oniguruma Library
Background Context
The project utilizes Ruby scripts to apply regular expressions. You'll be provided with specific requirements for each task, along with sample inputs and expected outputs. By completing these tasks, you'll gain practical experience in crafting effective regex patterns using the Oniguruma library.
