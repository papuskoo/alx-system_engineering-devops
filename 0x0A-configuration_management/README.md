Background Context
During my time at SlideShare, I developed an auto-remediation tool called Skynet. Skynet was designed to monitor, scale, and fix Cloud infrastructure automatically. It utilized MCollective, a parallel job-execution system, to execute commands across servers simultaneously. However, a bug in the code caused unexpected server terminations, leading to a critical incident. This experience highlighted the importance of configuration management tools like Puppet in maintaining stable and reliable infrastructure.
